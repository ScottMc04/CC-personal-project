                <p>Hi, I'm Scott McLaughlin and I am 17 and currently studying Full-Stack Development and wish to become a Software Developer.<br><br>
                    In my free time I like to exercise in the gym and play a variety of sports. I also enjoy playing games on my PC.

Since this was one of my first projects no javaScript was added in.<br><br> I incorporated responsive design by using media queries.
                         I also included the :hover CSS Selector to make the nav bar more interactive. I practiced my newly learnt skills of CSS Flexbox which was used to create the layout I desired.</p></div>

                        This project was created closly following client requirements. The program starts by adding a custom order which is saved to a .txt file and once the user is ready they get a choice to 'view' orders, 'update' orders or cancel their orders.
                        Next a search algorithm is used to find the users order and performs said task. Any completed order is added to the archive .txt file with relevant information like 'Order Name', 'Amount paid' and 'Towels Washed'.</div>

                        Multiple functions were used, one of them comparing the DNA of 2 simulated <i>pAeqour</i>. Objects and methods were created to store these new organisms. There is also a method to calculate the survival chance of the organisms with certain DNA structures.
                        <br> The random DNA bases were created using the 'Math' built-in object and for loops to cycle through each DNA base individually. </p>
