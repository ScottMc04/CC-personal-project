                <p>Hi, I'm Scott McLaughlin and I am 17 and currently studying Full-Stack Development and wish to become a Software Developer.<br><br>
                    In my free time I like to exercise in the gym and play a variety of sports. I also enjoy playing games on my PC.
                </p>

                    <div id="text-box1"><p>The Mounatin Club project was one of my first solo HTML 5 projects where I practiced creating a webpage from scratch and designing it myself with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Since this was one of my first projects no javaScript was added in.<br><br> I incorporated responsive design by using media queries.
                         I also included the :hover CSS Selector to make the nav bar more interactive. I practiced my newly learnt skills of CSS Flexbox which was used to create the layout I desired.</p></div>
